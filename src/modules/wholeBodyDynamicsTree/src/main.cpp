\defgroup wholeBodyDynamicsTree wholeBodyDynamicsTree

Estimates the external wrenches and internal torques
of a robot by fusing the information coming from
the dynamic model and the measurements
coming from the sensors of the robot.

\author Silvio Traversaro

\section intro_sec Description

This module estimates the external wrenches acting at any link of robot,
through a model based compensation
of the 6-axis force/torque (FT) sensor's measurements, which are
acquired through an input YARP port and provides them to an
output YARP ports.

The estimation is perfomed relying on rigid body dynamics using CAD
parameters.

The intrinsic offsets of the sensors, which are due to the stresses
generated during mounting, are defined by the initial FT sensor data.
Another source of offsets is the thermal drift of the sensors, to recalibrate
the sensors you can send (assuming that the robot is attached to a fixed base)
the `calib all` command to the RPC port of wholeBodyDynamicsTree
(see Ports Created section to get more information on how to access the RPC port).

\section lib_sec Libraries
- YARP library.
- iDynTree library.
- yarpWholeBodyInterface library

\section parameters_sec Parameters

--robot \e name
- The parameter \e name identifies the robot name. If not specified
  \e icub is assumed.

--period \e period
  The parameter \e period identifies the rate the estimation thread will work. If not
  specified \e 10ms is assumed.

--cutoff_imu \e cutoff_imu
  The parameter cutoff_imu specifies the cutoff frequency (in Hz) of the IMU low pass filter used in
  wholeBodyDynamicsTree. A typical values is 3.0 Hz. For more details on the filters used in
  wholeBodyDynamicsTree, plese check the filters section.

--cutoff_ft \e cutoff_ft
  The parameter cutoff_ft specifies the cutoff frequency (in Hz) of the six axis F/T low pass filter used in
  wholeBodyDynamicsTree. If cutoff_ft is not preset, not filtering is performed on the F/T measurements.
  For more details on the filters used in wholeBodyDynamicsTree, plese check the filters section.

--cutoff_velacc \e cutoff_velacc
  The parameter cutoff_velacc specifies the cutoff frequency (in Hz) of the joint velocity and acceleration low pass filter used in
  wholeBodyDynamicsTree. If cutoff_velacc is not preset, not filtering is performed on the joint velocity and acceleration measurements.
  For more details on the filters used in wholeBodyDynamicsTree, plese check the filters section.

\section portsa_sec Ports Accessed
Coming soon.

\section portsc_sec Ports Created
- \e /${name}/rpc:i
  This port enable to communicate via rpc with the module.
  To access it through the command line, open a terminal and write:
    yarp rpc /${name}/rpc:i
  Where ${name} is the name of the module (usually wholeBodyDynamics or wholeBodyDynamicsTree)
  After that, you can type `help` to get an overview of the available functions.
  If your robot is attached to the fixed base, the:
   > calib all
  command will be used to calibrate the FT sensors.

\section in_files_sec Input Data Files
None.

\section out_data_sec Output Data Files
None.

\section conf_file_sec Configuration Files

Configuration files of wholeBodyDynamicsTree load several groups,
to separate concerns about the different functionalities of the wholeBodyDynamicsTree.

\subsection `SIMPLE_LEGGED_ODOMETRY` group

  | Parameter name | Type | Units | Default Value | Required | Description | Notes |
  |:--------------:|:------:|:-----:|:-------------:|:--------:|:-----------:|:-----:|
  | initial_world_frame | string | - | - | Yes | Name of the frame of the model that is supposed to be coincident with the world/inertial at start | - |
  | initial_fixed_link  | string | - | - | Yes | Name of the link that is assumed to be fixed at start | - |
  | floating_base_frame  | string | - | - | Yes | Name of the frame assume to be the floating base | - |
  | stream_com           | -      | - | - | No  | If present, open a port /${name}/com:o where you stream the COM position in world coordinates | - |
  | additional_frames    | list of strings | - | - | No  | If present, open a port /${name}/frames:o where a Bottle of states of additional frames is streamed | - |

Consider that this values are just initialization values, but you can always
reset/change fixed link of the simple legged odometry using the RPC port.

It the odometry is correctly configured, the /${name}/floatingbasestate:o port
will stream a bottle with three lists, that are:
 * the 4x4 Transform yarp::sig::Matrix representing the world_H_floatingbase transform
(i.e. the matrix that transforms position homogenous vectors expressed in the floatingbase frame to
 vector expressed in the world frame)
 * The 6x1 yarp::sig::Vector of the coordinates of the base link twist

\section tested_os_sec Tested OS
Linux and OS X.

\section example_sec Example
If you properly setted the YARP_ROBOT_NAME enviromental variable,
and if you provide a proper wholeBodyDynamicsTree.ini configuration file
you can simply launch wholeBodyDynamicsTree using the following command:

\code
wholeBodyDynamicsTree --autoconnect
\endcode

\section filters Filters
wholeBodyDynamicsTree has optional support for filtering
the measurement that reads from sensors. In particular it supports
filtering of:
 - the IMU readings. If the assume_fixed option is not used, wholeBodyDynamicsTree
   get the information about the gravity, the linear acceleration and the angular
   velocity and acceleration on a link in which a IMU is mounted. The default
   setup is to filter this readings with a first order low pass filter (implemented in
   iCub::ctrl::realtime::FirstOrderLowPassFilter) with a cutoff frequency of 3hz .
   This cutoff frequency can be changed with the cutoff_imu configuration parameter.
 - the six axis F/T sensors readings. By default wholeBodyDynamicsTree does not filter
   this readings, but an optional first order low pass filter can be specified using the
   cutoff_ft configuration parameter. In the case the cutoff_ft parameter is specified,
   the cutoff frequency (in Hz) of the filter is given by the value of the cutoff_ft parametes.
 - the encoder velocity and acceleration By default wholeBodyDynamicsTree does not filter
   this readings (that are normally obtained from low level numerical differentiation),
   but an optional first order low pass filter can be specified using the
   cutoff_velacc configuration parameter. In the case the cutoff_velacc parameter is specified,
   the cutoff frequency (in Hz) of the filter is given by the value of the cutoff_velacc parameter.

\section sensorTimeout Sensor Timeout
wholeBodyDynamicsTree relies on the underlyng yarp devices to detect sensor timeout.
Currently the only device that is checking for a timeout is the RemoteControlBoard,
that is used to read encoders position, velocity and accelerations. In the RemoteControlBoard
a fixed timeout of 0.5 seconds is used : if no measurement is received in that time, the
reading of the sensor will be considered failed.
If the sensor reading fails in a period, no estimation is published on the YARP network
in that period.
If for 10 consecutive periods of the wholeBodyDynamicsTree module (the default period is 10 ms)
the reading of the sensors fails, wholeBodyDynamicsTree module shutdowns automatically. 
Check [issue 161 of codyco-modules issue tracker](https://github.com/robotology/codyco-modules/issues/161)
for more information on why this feature was introduced.
